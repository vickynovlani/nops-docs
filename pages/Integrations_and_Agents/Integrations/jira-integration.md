**Adding Jira Integration**
===========================

With nOps new OAuth 2.0 Jira integration, nOps has simplified the process to attach your Jira instance. This allows you to quickly create and assign task for issues discovered by nOps. To integrate Jira using a simple sign up process you must allow access to your Atlassian account. Once completed you can create and assign a Jira ticket in your company's Jira environment without having to leave nOps.

Key features of the Integration
===============================

Among the key features of the integration are that:

* All users are able to add Jira tickets and you do not need to be a Jira or nOps Admin user to do so. For your convenience we have described 2 ways in which you can integrate Jira.
    
* The integration is simple and does not require extensive configuration, however you must provide a link to your companies Atlassian Jira account in order to connect it.
    
* Once the integration is complete you can create a Jira ticket through any **Resource Details** dialogs. These are available from any of the following areas**:**
    
    * Spot Advisor
        
    * Tag Explorer
        
    * Resource Rightsizing
        
    * nOps Rules
        
    * AWS Inventory
        
    * SOC2, HIPAA, CIS Readiness Reports
        
    * Workloads
