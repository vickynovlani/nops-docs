## nOps Dashboard ##
==============

The nOps Dashboard summarizes changes in your cloud costs and allows you to choose what period of time to compare. The cost changes are broken out by:

* Cloud Accounts
    
* Cloud Services
    
* Usage types
    
* Operations
    

The order of these sections is constant and reflects the general impact to your cloud spend. Individual line items are listed within each group ordered by spend,

Buttons at the upper right enable you to choose which **cloud-account types** to include and also whether the cost comparison should be **monthly**, **month-to-date**,  or **weekly**.

Note that the Cloud Accounts summary at the top includes links to give you detail of **potential savings** and **underutilized resources**.

Note also the **View More** link at the bottom left of the individual items partial list in each group, to show all records for that group.
