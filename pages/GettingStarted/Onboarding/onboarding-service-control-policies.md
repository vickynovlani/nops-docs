# Onboarding to nOps with Service Control Policies (SCP) #

As cloud security becomes more of a concern, the adoption of Control Tower and Service Control Policies (SCP) has increased substantially.  Because of their nature, SCPS can inhibit nOps from viewing necessary resource information to make cost optimization recommendations.  It can also impact visibility capabilities, such as looking at resource tags.

Our recommendation is to add an exception for the nOps role(s) to be ignored by the SCPs.

This can be done by adding an ArnNotLike statement for the Nops-Integration role name with a wildcard.

```json
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                        "eu-central-1",
                        "eu-west-1"
                    ]
                },
                "ArnNotLike": {
                    "aws:PrincipalARN": [
                        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/StackSet-nOps-Integration*",
                        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/Nops-Integration*"
                    ]
                }
```
