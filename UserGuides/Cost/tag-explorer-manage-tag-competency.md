# Tag Explorer - Manage Tag Competency

### How to use Tag Explorer ###


## Tag Explorer ##
============

The Tag Explorer feature allows you to assess tags you attached to resources for billing information to better organize your costs. Such as costs for different stacks, customers, environments, projects, departments, or teams. Displaying the current information will highlight untagged resources. Following are some terms and what they mean:

**Tag Key:** is top level of the tag.

**Tag Value:** you can assign more than one tag value to a tag key. For example:

*   Application: Production
    
*   Application: Testing
    

**Use Case:** Use tags to understand the cost of all the resources used to run an app. You can report on Tag Keys and Tag values. It's an easier way to group resources to view their corresponding costs

This feature is available from a Client Page.

On the NavBar click **Cost Explorer > Tag Explorer**
